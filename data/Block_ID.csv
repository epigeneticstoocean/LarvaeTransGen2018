B1,Mistakes we caught: mislabeling the jar treatment in the database; putting jars back in the wrong sea table; double entering male/female crosses; missed a temperature reading for one of the bottle chemistrys; missed a pH reading for one of the larvae jars; spreadsheet calculation error; not taking the water chemistry bottles from the carboys at the right time; forgot to use cryodots for the adults used in the crosses. Things to do better: standardize how we get eggs from females and sperm from males,20180713,20180615,20180710
B2,"Mistakes we caught: control females not swirled before moving into 25mL for fertilization, but visually checked; this was probably a huge mistake, oh well lesson learned; Females with low eggs: CF06 and CF08, CF04 was medium-low; CF03 had variable low eggs because of swirling issue; CF04xCM04 used meth bottle; 13 control families; forgot to write down the time the methylation samples were frozen",,,20180724
B3,"Mistakes we caught: several control oysters were observed to have been spent. These were labeled as ""I"" in the data; lots of what looked like little eggs; the ""NA"" crosses did not have enough larvae for QG. However they were still filtered down for METH; The diagonal was filtered on Days 0 and 3; The off-diagonal crosses were added to Alan's experiment.  ",20180810,,20180807
